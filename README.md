## ✨ Project Overview

This project is a dynamic, personalized portfolio website designed to solve the common developer challenge: presenting skills and projects in an **engaging and visually appealing** way. Moving beyond the static limitations of a traditional resume, this site utilizes modern front-end tools to deliver a smooth, interactive user experience with captivating animations.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Dynamic Sections:** Includes dedicated sections for **About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact**.
* **Smooth Navigation:** Uses **JavaScript** for programmatic smooth scrolling between all major sections, ensuring a fluid transition.
* **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Implements **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** and **ScrollMagic** to create interactive animations that fire as the user scrolls, such as animating skill progress bars and fading in project cards.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized with **CSS** for viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **Engaging Project Showcase:** Presents projects using visually appealing layouts with interactive elements like hover effects.
