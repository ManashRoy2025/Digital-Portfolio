# üöÄ Interactive Digital Portfolio

## Project Title: Dynamic Developer Portfolio

### üåü Overview
This project is a dynamic, personalized digital portfolio website designed to present my skills, experience, and projects in an engaging and interactive way. It addresses the common challenge developers face where a traditional resume lacks visual appeal and the ability to showcase interactive work.

The portfolio is built with smooth navigation, subtle animations, and a responsive design to look great on any device.

### ‚ú® Key Features
* **Smooth Scroll Navigation:** Easy navigation between sections (Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, Contact).
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing.
* **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Content fades in elegantly as the user scrolls into a new section, enhancing engagement. (Implemented using native JavaScript Intersection Observer).
* **Dedicated Sections:** Clear presentation of **About Me**, **Skills**, **Projects**, and a functional **Contact** form.
